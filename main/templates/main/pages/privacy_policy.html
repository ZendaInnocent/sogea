                <h4>This policy covers Sogea Community.</h4>

                <h4 class="my-3"><strong>What information Sogea Community collects and Why</strong></h4>
                <p>In order to give you the best possible experience using Sogea Community, we collect information from your interactions with our network. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. We collect this basic information from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>
                <p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The visitor’s browser type</li>
                    <li>Referring site</li>
                    <li>The date and time of each visitor request</li>
                    <li>We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We use this information to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide, test, improve, promote and personalize Sogea Community Services</li>
                    <li>Generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use Sogea Community Services</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In order for you to create an account on Sogea Community and use our Services, we need to collect and process certain information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);</li>
                    <li>Information that you submit on or to Sogea Community in the form of reactions, comments, or messages to other users;</li>
                    <li>The email address associated with your Twitter account, if you choose to sign up using your Twitter credentials. Sogea Community will also request permission to access additional information (these permissions are governed by Twitter’s privacy policies and can be managed through your Twitter privacy settings).

                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Information Disclosure</strong></h4>
                <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for commercial purposes.</p>
                <p>We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Sogea Community. For example, we may share information pertaining to the popularity of different programming languages for advertising partners.</p>
                <p>We do host first-party advertising on Sogea Community. We do not run any code from advertisers and all ad images are hosted on managed Sogea Community servers. For more details, see our section on Advertising Details.</p>
                <p>We may use User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have authorized.</p>
                <p>We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement. Our third party vendors are listed below.</p>
                <h3><strong>Advertising Details</strong></h3>
                <p>We target advertisements based solely upon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Details of the page where the advertisement is shown, including:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>We allow advertisers to target ads to a list of keywords advertising.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may place ads in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sidebars</li>
                    <li>Below articles</li>

                    <li>Our dedicated Sponsors page</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All registered members have the ability to disable advertisements — where reasonable — through their Settings page. For instance, it’s not feasible to disable certain advertisements in the form of recognition posts, site-wide contests, dedicated sponsorship page, etc.</p>
                <h3><strong>Third Party Vendors</strong></h3>
                <p><b>We may share your account information with third parties in some circumstances, including: </b>1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) for survey or research purposes, after aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonomization; (4) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (5) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone.</p>
                <h3><strong>Data Storage</strong></h3>
                <p>Sogea Community uses third-party vendors and hosting partners for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run Sogea Community. By using Sogea Community Services, you authorize Sogea Community to transfer, store, and use your information in the United Republic of Tanzania and any other country where we operate. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.</p>
                <h3><strong>Site monitoring</strong></h3>
                <p>Sogea Community uses a variety of third-party services to diagnose errors and improve the performance of our site. We aim to minimize the amount of personal information shared, but the information may include your IP address or other identifying information. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.</p>
                <h3><strong>Payment processing</strong></h3>
                <p>Sogea Community does not process payments directly — we rely on third-party services such as Stripe, Mobile Payments such as Mpesa, Tigo Pesa etc., and Paypal to receive payments and store any payment information.</p>
                <h3><strong>Third-Party Embeds</strong></h3>
                <p>Some of the content that you see displayed on Sogea Community is not hosted by Sogea Community. These “embeds” are hosted by a third-party and embedded in Sogea Community. For example: YouTube videos, Codepens, Twitter tweets, or GitHub code that appear within a Sogea Community post. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a Sogea Community post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, YouTube receives data about your activity). Sogea Community does not control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they will do with it. Third-party embeds on Sogea Community are not covered by this privacy policy; they are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service. Be mindful when interacting with these services.</p>
                <h3><strong>Facebook (visitor action pixel)</strong></h3>
                <p>We use the “visitor action pixels” from Facebook Inc on our website.</p>
                <p>This allows user behavior to be tracked after they have been redirected to our website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Facebook may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Usage Policy. You can object to the collection of your data by Facebook pixel, or to the use of your data for the purpose of displaying Facebook ads by contacting the following address: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads.</p>
                <h3><strong>Tracking & Cookies</strong></h3>

                <h3><strong>Data Security</strong></h3>
                <p>We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.</p>
                <h3><strong>Administrative Emails from Sogea Community</strong></h3>
                <p>Sometimes we’ll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can’t opt out of this type of “transactional” email (unless you delete your account).</p>
